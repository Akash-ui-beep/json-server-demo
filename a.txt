Step 1 — Create Backend on Render

Sign in to Render.

Click New → Web Service.

Connect your GitHub repository containing:

package.json

server.js

db.json

Configure the service:

Name: json-server-demo

Branch: main

Language: Node

Build Command: npm install

Start Command: npm start

Instance Type: Free

Click Create Web Service.

Wait for deployment → Render provides a live backend URL (e.g., https://json-server-demo-fw3t.onrender.com/products).

Step 2 — Create Frontend Online in CodeSandbox

Go to CodeSandbox
 → Create Sandbox → HTML + CSS template.

Set fields:

Name: microservice-frontend

Visibility: Private (or Public if you want to share)

Folder: Default / Drafts

Step 3 — Add Frontend Files

index.html → HTML layout + Add Product form.

style.css → Styling for form and product cards.

script.js → JavaScript to fetch and add products.

Make sure index.html links correctly:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
<script src="script.js"></script>

Step 4 — Connect Frontend to Backend

In script.js, set the Render backend URL:

const apiUrl = 'https://json-server-demo-fw3t.onrender.com/products';


Use fetch() to:

Load all products (GET)

Add a new product (POST)

Step 5 — Preview and Test

Click Preview in CodeSandbox.

Verify:

Product list loads dynamically from Render.

Add Product form works → new products appear immediately.

Check browser console for errors → should be none.

Step 6 — Optional / Notes

Backend → Always accessible via Render URL; free instances may “wake up” if idle.

Frontend → Runs in CodeSandbox; for permanent access, can be hosted on GitHub Pages or Netlify.

You now have a fully functional online microservices experiment. ✅
